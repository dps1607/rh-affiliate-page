            <h2 class="section-title">About Dr. Nashat Latib</h2>
            <p>Dr. Nashat Latib is not your average fertility voice. She's a double board-certified physician — one of fewer than 1,000 in the world trained in both Emergency Medicine and Functional Medicine (IFMCP). But her journey into fertility care wasn't born in a clinic. It began with her own search for answers, her willingness to question conventional timelines, and her unshakable belief that every woman deserves the chance to become a mother — naturally, whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Through her signature 4R Fertility Formula®, Dr. Latib has helped women who had all but given up — including those with multiple failed IVF or IUI cycles — finally conceive and carry healthy pregnancies. Her approach doesn't rely on fads or fear. It's evidence-based, root-cause medicine, delivered with the same urgency, precision, and compassion she honed in the ER — but now directed toward creating life, not saving it.</p>
            <p>By partnering with Dr. Latib, you're aligning your platform with a leader who embodies both medical authority and mission-driven care — and whose programs have changed the lives of families across the country.</p>
